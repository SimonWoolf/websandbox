websandbox
==========
'Html-&-css made fun' app. Everyone has their sandbox, they or their friends can edit it. Click an element for a pop-up that lets you edit its HTML and CSS. Complete version history is stored, can revert any previous state. 

Done as a project at Makers in a team of 2, with [Nicki Keszler](https://github.com/nkeszler).

Ruby/rails app using bundler for dependencies, run `bundle install` before
using. Run with `rackup`. Test with `rspec`. Dev and test environments by default require a local postgresql instance with `websandbox_development` and `websandbox_test` databases respectively.

Running instance at http://websandbox.herokuapp.com/
